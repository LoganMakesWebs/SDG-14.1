    Protect Our Oceans - SDG 14.1

<section>
    <h2>What is SDG 14.1?</h2>
    <p>SDG 14.1 focuses on reducing marine pollution, especially plastic waste, to protect aquatic life and ecosystems.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Why is Plastic Pollution a Problem?</h2>
    <p>Every year, millions of tons of plastic enter our oceans, harming marine life and disrupting ecosystems.</p>

    <h2>Our Responsibility: An Essay on SDG 14.1</h2>
    <p>
        The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 14.1 is dedicated to reducing marine pollution,
        particularly from land-based activities. This goal is crucial because oceans are the lifeblood of our planet,
        covering over 70% of the Earth's surface and providing oxygen, food, and climate regulation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Plastic pollution is one of the biggest threats to marine ecosystems. Over 8 million tons of plastic
        end up in the ocean each year, causing harm to marine animals who ingest or get entangled in it.
        This pollution does not just affect wildlife; it also impacts human communities by contaminating food sources,
        disrupting economies reliant on fishing and tourism, and contributing to climate change.
    </p>
    <p>
        The fight against ocean pollution requires global cooperation. Governments must implement strict waste management
        policies, companies should invest in sustainable packaging, and individuals can make a difference by reducing
        single-use plastics and participating in cleanup efforts. By working together, we can restore the health of
        our oceans and ensure a sustainable future for all.
